# Welcome

- **Who Am I?**  
  My name is Silver, I'm a speedrunner and YouTube content creator
- **What do I do?**  
  I work in IT as my profession but outside of that, I like to play video games and make content around them
- **What will you find here?**  
  You'll find projects of mine where I mess around and just make whatever I think of
- **How else to find me?**  
  I go by MHFsilver on pretty much everywhere, [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/MHFsilver_), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mhfsilver) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/mhfsilver)
